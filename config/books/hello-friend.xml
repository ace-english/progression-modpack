			<title>Nutrition, Food, and Cooking</title>
			<p>Nutrition matters now. Press "N" or click on the carrot button in your inventory to bring up your nutrition stats.</p>
			<p>Keeping your nutrition from dropping too low is important, because at low levels you may experience the "Miner's Fatigue" debuff.</p>
        </page>
        <page>
			<p>If you keep your nutrition levels high, you can recieve various buffs, such as Strength or Toughness. Building up a tolerance to spicy food can lead you to resist fire damage!</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Additionally, eating a variety of food matters more now. Eating the same food over and over will have diminishing returns.</p>
        </page>
        <page>
            <p>Eating new foods can lead to a permanent increase in your health bar.</p>

			<title>Enabling Shaders</title>
			<p align="center" color="#606060">"RTX on!"</p>
			<p>To make Minecraft look hella good, go into Options > Video settings > Shaders. We have pre-loaded a couple for you to try out. Jakob likes Sildur's High. Experiment and see which options you like best. You can also download your own and install locally by putting them in the Shaders folder.</p>
        </page>
        <page>
			<p>To get bump maps and reflective textures, go into Resource Packs and select one with advanced materials. We have pre-loaded Vanilla PBR and AVPBR, but you can find others online. Make sure to turn on the "Advanced Materials" setting in your Shaders settings.</p>

			<title>Seasons and Agriculture</title>
			<p>Seasons have been brought to Minecraft. You can watch the leaves turn colors and snow come to biomes that normally don't see it.</p>
			<p>Not all crops can grow in all seasons. You can grow underground or in a greenhouse to tolerate the changing weather, however.</p>
			<p>Many crops and trees can be achieved using cross-breeding. Check out <link ref="recipes:agricraft">Agricraft</link> to get started with breeding stronger crops, and creating new ones.</p>
        </page>
        <page>
			<p>New foods can be found by breaking gardens. Turn these into seeds in your crafting menu, or cook them into delicious new foods.</p>
			<p>To breed new trees, flowers, and resource bees, check out <link>Forestry</link>.</p>
			<p>Animals have also been made more complex and interesting. They have to be kept happy to produce resources, and most can only be milked when nursing. Check out <link ref="recipes:animania">Animania</link> to get into animal husbandry.</p>
